## D1 Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to the dataset results, ground_clearance and vehicle_length (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely 
to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 
In other words the ground_clearance and vehicle_length have a significant impact on mpg.

2- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
According to the multiple linear regression model, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero 
because the standard error of the estimates and the "t-value" are both provided to show how the p-value calculated. 
in the summary ouput, the actual p-value of the hypothesis test was 5.35e-11. which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level. 
That means that the linear regression model gives us a reliable estimates. 

3-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

According to the summary output, the multiple regression model does an adequate job of predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes 
because the multiple r-squared value was 0.71 while the p-value remained significant. Which means that roughly 71% of the time the model will 
predict mpg values correctly. Most likely, there are other, more influential variables and factors that were not recorded in the data set,
factors contributing to the change in mpg for the MechaCar prototype.

## D2 The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils 
must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification 
for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

According to the result, Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both within design specifications, 
and both have the same calculated mean and median. However, Lot 3 is far more variable than the other manufacturing lots.
Lot 3 has a calculated variance that exceeds the manufacturing specs. If we combine all three lots and look at the total data, 
the overall calculated variance is within specifications.
